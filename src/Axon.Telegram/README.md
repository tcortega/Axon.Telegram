Axon.Telegram
==============

This package is a metapackage for Axon.Telegram, providing references to
everything you need to get started. Note that this package implies a dependency
on the latest version of Axon.Telegram's main packages, with no regard for API
compatibility across builds.

Production packages/projects should probably prefer explicit dependencies
instead.
